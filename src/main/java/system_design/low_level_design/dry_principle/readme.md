The **DRY Principle** stands for **"Don't Repeat Yourself"**. Itâ€™s a software development principle aimed at reducing repetition in code, which improves maintainability, reduces bugs, and keeps your code clean and efficient.

Letâ€™s break it down:

---

### **What is the DRY Principle?**
- Avoid writing duplicate code by **abstracting reusable logic** into methods, classes, or modules.
- Whenever you find yourself copying and pasting code or repeating similar logic, it's a sign that you might be violating the DRY principle.

---

### **Why is DRY Important?**
1. **Maintainability**: Changes need to be made in only one place.
2. **Readability**: Code is easier to understand when logic isnâ€™t scattered.
3. **Reusability**: Centralized logic can be reused across the application.
4. **Reduced Errors**: Fixing a bug in one location fixes it everywhere that logic is used.

### **How to Apply DRY in Java?**
Here are some practical ways to follow DRY in Java:

#### 1. **Use Methods for Repeated Code**
If you notice repeated blocks of code, move them into a method and call the method where needed.

**Example**:
```java
// Without DRY
public class Calculator {
    public void calculateSum() {
        System.out.println("Adding numbers...");
        System.out.println("Result: " + (5 + 10));
    }

    public void calculateDifference() {
        System.out.println("Subtracting numbers...");
        System.out.println("Result: " + (10 - 5));
    }
}
```

**With DRY**:
```java
public class Calculator {
    private void printResult(String operation, int result) {
        System.out.println(operation + " numbers...");
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);
    }

    public void calculateSum() {
        printResult("Adding", 5 + 10);
    }

    public void calculateDifference() {
        printResult("Subtracting", 10 - 5);
    }
}
```

#### 2. **Leverage Inheritance**
Inheritance allows you to reuse common functionality in a base class.

**Without DRY**:
```java
class Dog {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Dog is eating...");
    }
}

class Cat {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Cat is eating...");
    }
}
```

**With DRY**:
```java
class Animal {
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Animal is eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal { }
class Cat extends Animal { }
```

---

#### 3. **Use Constants for Repeated Values**
Avoid hardcoding the same value multiple times. Use constants or enums instead.

**Without DRY**:
```java
System.out.println("Error Code: 404");
System.out.println("Error Code: 404");
```

**With DRY**:
```java
class Constants {
    public static final int ERROR_CODE_NOT_FOUND = 404;
}

System.out.println("Error Code: " + Constants.ERROR_CODE_NOT_FOUND);
System.out.println("Error Code: " + Constants.ERROR_CODE_NOT_FOUND);
```

---

#### 4. **Use Loops to Handle Repeated Logic**
If youâ€™re repeating similar logic for different values, use a loop.

**Without DRY**:
```java
System.out.println("Item 1: Apple");
System.out.println("Item 2: Banana");
System.out.println("Item 3: Orange");
```

**With DRY**:
```java
String[] items = {"Apple", "Banana", "Orange"};
for (int i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
    System.out.println("Item " + (i + 1) + ": " + items[i]);
}
```

---

#### 5. **Parameterize Logic**
When logic is repeated with slight variations, use parameters.

**Without DRY**:
```java
public void sendEmailToAdmin() {
    System.out.println("Sending email to admin@example.com...");
}

public void sendEmailToUser() {
    System.out.println("Sending email to user@example.com...");
}
```

**With DRY**:
```java
public void sendEmail(String recipient) {
    System.out.println("Sending email to " + recipient + "...");
}
```

---

### **Signs Youâ€™re Violating DRY**
- **Copy-Paste Coding**: Same code exists in multiple places.
- **Hardcoded Values**: Repeated constants or dsa.strings.
- **Scattered Logic**: Similar logic implemented in multiple places instead of being centralized.

---

### **Tips for a Machine Coding Interview**
1. **Identify Repetition Early**: Spot patterns or repeated logic in the problem.
2. **Break Down Requirements**: Modularize your solution into methods or classes.
3. **Write Clean Code**: Use descriptive method and variable names to make your abstractions clear.
4. **Test Reusable Code**: Ensure that your reused logic works for all scenarios.
